# Decision Tree tutorials in Excel
A respository of materials for decision tree tutorials using Microsoft Excel.

## Building a decision tree using Excel 
I created a video tutorial on how to construct a decision tree using Excel. You can view the video on my Dropbox folder [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vejw8k2kpj3f39rzxmz23/SPPS-209-Building-a-decision-tree-SP-2023.mp4?rlkey=aodvsqxp0vhaocslglaewly97&dl=0).

## One-way sensitivity analysis using Excel
I wrote a blog on how to build a tornado diagram using Excel VBA macros. I posted this on my website [here](https://mbounthavong.com/blog/2024/5/18/using-excel-vba-macros-to-conduct-one-way-sensitivity-analyses-and-tornado-diagram). 

The Excel file with the VBA macros is located in [this repository](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Decision-Tree-tutorials-in-Excel/tree/main/One-way%20sensitivity%20analysis). Note: When opening the `*.xlsm` file, make sure to enable macros. 

## Tree Builder app
The University of Pittsburgh has an `html` application that can generate nice decision trees. You will need to download all the contents in this [folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/vk1g5oiqdaepk2bfhs5oh/ABZO08pVsZACqpG1xPtOUgA?rlkey=7edfwjw67qpz00zuvdmxbnmxk&dl=0) into a personal folder on your hard drive. Once the contents have been saved, you will need to double-click on the `index.html` file to open the application in a browser.
